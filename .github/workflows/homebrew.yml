# **what?**
# This workflow installs the latest version of each dbt adapter from homebrew.
# It then run 'dbt --version' to verify the installation was successful. 
# If it fails for the scheduled runs, it will post to our team alerts channel.

# **why?**
# This is a simple way to test all adapter installations at a single
# time. It allows us to test them on a schedule as well to check for 
# any breaking dependency changes that might happen and alert us on it.

# **when?**
# This workflow will run on a schedule every night and also can be
# manually invoked.
