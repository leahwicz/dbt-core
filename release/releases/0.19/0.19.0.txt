### Breaking changes

- The format for `sources.json`, `run-results.json`, `manifest.json`, and `catalog.json` has changed:
    - Each now has a common metadata dictionary ([#2761](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2761), [#2778](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2778)). The contents include: schema and dbt versions ([#2670](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2670), [#2767](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2767)); `invocation_id` ([#2763](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2763), [#2784](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2784)); custom environment variables prefixed with `DBT_ENV_CUSTOM_ENV_` ([#2764](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2764), [#2785](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2785)); cli and rpc arguments in the `run_results.json` ([#2510](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2510), [#2813](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2813)).
    - Remove `injected_sql` from manifest nodes, use `compiled_sql` instead ([#2762](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2762), [#2834](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2834))
- Defer if and only if upstream reference does not exist in current environment namespace ([#2909](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2909), [#2946](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2946))
- Rationalize run result status reporting and clean up artifact schema ([#2493](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2493), [#2943](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2943))
- Add adapter specific query execution info to run results and source freshness results artifacts. Statement call blocks return `response` instead of `status`, and the adapter method `get_status` is now `get_response` ([#2747](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2747), [#2961](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2961))

## Kiyoshi Kuromiya (1943–2000)

> Thanks to @amychen1776 for writing this biography of Kiyoshi Kuromiya―a famous Philadelphian, and the namesake of this dbt release.

To boil down all of Kiyoshi Kuromiya's accomplishments to a few sentences would be an act not unlike trying to boil down the Pacific Ocean to mere salt. There will be many remnants missing but you will at least have a glimpse at how he has shaped the world. 

Born at a Japanese American internment camp in Wyoming, Kiyoshi's life began in conflict. He would go on to live a life centered around being a voice for the marginalized. His intersectional activism span from racial injustice to LGBTQA rights as well as protesting war. Though [not born and raised in West Philadelphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBe0VCso0qs), Kiyoshi became a Philadelphian in 1961 when he started at the University of Pennsylvania.  There, he began to explore his multi-faceted identities as well as progress his activism. 

One of the ways he attracted attention to his causes was theatrics. He once staged an event on the library steps at Penn, threatening to burn a dog alive. When thousands turn to protest, he flipped the narrative by delivering the message: "Congratulations on your anti-napalm protest. You saved the life of a dog. Now, how about saving the lives of tens of thousands of people in Vietnam?" 

Kiyoshi was also one of the few Asian Americans who openly supported the Civil Rights Movement. He was a close confidant to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, to the point of taking care of his children in the days after King's assassination. As an openly gay delegate to the Black Panther Convention, he played a part in the organization's recognization of the connections between racial injustice and the Gay Rights Movement. He was also a founding member of the Gay Liberation Front - Philadelphia group. 

Outside of his involvement in the civil rights movement, Kiyoshi was widely known for his work for the AIDS community. He was actively involved in several AIDS organizations in Philadelphia, including  being the editor of the ACT-UP Standard of Care, the first such publication for the care of people living with HIV. He was a treatment activist and clinical trials participant, fighting for research that involved the community in its design. His advocacy for people of color, drug users, women, and incarcerated individuals would ensure hundreds of folks had access to up-to-date treatment information and resources. 

He passed away in 2000 due to AIDS-related complications but his legacy to social justice will forever live on. ✊🏿
