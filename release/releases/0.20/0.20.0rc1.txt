commit: 65908b3
branch: develop
version: 0.20.0rc1

An initial release candidate for v0.20.0.

### Breaking changes
- Fix adapter.dispatch macro resolution when statically extracting macros. Introduce new project-level `dispatch` config. The `packages` argument to `dispatch` no longer supports macro calls; there is backwards compatibility for existing packages. The argument will no longer be supported in a future release, instead provide the `macro_namespace` argument. ([#3362](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3362), [#3363](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3363), [#3383](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3383), [#3403](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3403))

### Features
- Support optional `updated_at` config parameter with `check` strategy snapshots. If not supplied, will use current timestamp (default). ([#1844](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/1844), [#3376](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3376))
