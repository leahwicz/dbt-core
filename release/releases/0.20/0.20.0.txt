### Breaking changes
- Add Jinja tag for generic test definitions. Replacement for macros prefixed `test_` ([#1173](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/1173), [#3261](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3261))
- Update schema/generic tests to expect a set of rows instead of a single numeric value, and to use test materialization when executing. ([#3192](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3192), [#3286](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3286))
- **Plugin maintainers:** For adapters that inherit from other adapters (e.g. `dbt-postgres` &rarr; `dbt-redshift`), `adapter.dispatch()` will now include parent macro implementations as viable candidates ([#2923](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2923), [#3296](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3296))
- Fix adapter.dispatch macro resolution when statically extracting macros. Introduce new project-level `dispatch` config. The `packages` argument to `dispatch` no longer supports macro calls; there is backwards compatibility for existing packages. The argument will no longer be supported in a future release, instead provide the `macro_namespace` argument. ([#3362](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3362), [#3363](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3363), [#3383](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3383), [#3403](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3403))
- Bump schema versions for run results and manifest artifacts ([#3422](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3422), [#3421](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3421))

## Margaret Mead (1901â€“1978)

> Thanks to @amyd123 for writing this biography of Margaret Meadâ€”a famous Philadelphian, and the namesake of this dbt release.

The most striking thing about Margaret Mead is that although she died more than 40 years ago, her interests and advocacy are as relevant as ever - she was a campaigner for reproductive rights, fought against discrmination against LGBT scientists, and for a greater understanding of how racism affects individuals in American society. Her interests as a researcher focused on how we can help adolescent girls navigate the complexities of the modern world  - in the 1920s! 

Born in Philadelphia to a Quaker family in 1901, Mead became one of the nationâ€™s most public intellectuals, popularizing the field of anthropology, and tirelessly campaigning for various social issues until her death in 1978. Mead began her field work in the 1920s, leading to her first book Coming of Age in Samoa. This began more than two decades of anthropological field work focusing on the lives of families across the preliterate cultures of the Pacific. 

One of the major themes of her scholarly work was that gender roles are largely determined by culture, not biology, and as a corollary, that we have the ability as a society to build a culture that allows all people to realize their full potential. Although Meadâ€™s work focused on the Pacific, her interest was squarely on how to use the knowledge gained from anthropology to create a better society in the US. She brought these ideas out of academia and made them more accessible to the public by writing for magazines like Life, Time, Parents Magazine, and Redbook.

In more recent years, Meadâ€™s work has come under fire for being a product of some of the colonialist biases of her time, and based on fieldwork considered less rigorous than current standards dictate. However, Meadâ€™s fundamental contribution remains -- in the 1920s, when Mead began her career, genetic determinism was the scientific consensus in the West.  Mead was one of the first researchers to illustrate that many of our beliefs and actions are shaped by culture and our environment, and to use that understanding as a way to challenge ourselves to build the society we want to live in.
