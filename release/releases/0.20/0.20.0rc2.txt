A second release candidate for v0.20.0.

### Fixes

- Handle quoted values within test configs, such as `where` ([#3458](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3458), [#3459](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3459))

### Docs

### Under the hood 

- Swap experimental parser implementation to use Rust [#3497](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3497)
- Dispatch the core SQL statement of the new test materialization, to benefit adapter maintainers ([#3465](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3465), [#3461](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3461))
- Minimal validation of yaml dictionaries prior to partial parsing ([#3246](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3246), [#3460](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3460))
- Add partial parsing tests and improve partial parsing handling of macros ([#3449](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3449), [#3505](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3505))
- Update project loading event data to include experimental parser information. ([#3438](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3438), [#3495](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3495))
