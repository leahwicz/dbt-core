commit: b94b2e5
branch: 0.20.latest
version: 0.20.1rc1

An initial release candidate for v0.20.1.

### Features
- Adds `install-prerelease` parameter to hub packages in `packages.yml`. When set to `True`, allows prerelease packages to be installed. By default, this parameter is False unless explicitly set to True.

### Fixes
- Fix config merge behavior with experimental parser [3637](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3637)
- Fix exception on yml files with all comments [3568](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3568)
- Fix `store_failures` config when defined as a modifier for `unique` and `not_null` tests ([#3575](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3575), [#3577](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3577))
- Fix `where` config with `relationships` test by refactoring test SQL. Note: The default `relationships` test now includes CTEs, and may need reimplementing on adapters that don't support CTEs nested inside subqueries. ([#3579](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/3579), [#3583](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/3583))
- Partial parsing: don't reprocess SQL file already scheduled ([#3589](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3589), [#3620](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3620))
- Handle interator functions in model config ([#3573](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3573))
- Partial parsing: fix error after changing empty yaml file ([#3567](https://gith7ub.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3567), [#3618](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3618))
- Partial parsing: handle source tests when changing test macro ([#3584](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3584), [#3620](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3620))
- Fix `dbt deps` version comparison logic which was causing incorrect pre-release package versions to be installed. ([#3578](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3578), [#3609](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3609))
- Partial parsing: schedule new macro file for parsing when macro patching ([#3627](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3627), [#3627](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3627))
- Use `SchemaParser`'s render context to render test configs in order to support `var()` configured at the project level and passed in from the cli ([#3564](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3564). [#3646](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3646))
- Partial parsing: check unique_ids when recursively removing macros ([#3636](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3636))

### Under the hood
- Add tracking for determine why `dbt` needs to re-parse entire project when partial parsing is enabled ([#3572](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3572), [#3652](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/pull/3652))

### Docs
- Fix docs site crash if `relationships` test has one dependency instead of two ([docs#207](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-docs/issues/207), ([docs#208](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-docs/issues/208)))

### Under the hood
- Handle exceptions from anonymous usage tracking for users of `dbt-snowflake` on Apple M1 chips ([#3162](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3162), [#3661](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt/issues/3661))
