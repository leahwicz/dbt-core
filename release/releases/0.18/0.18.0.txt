### Breaking changes
- Previously, dbt put macros from all installed plugins into the namespace. This version of dbt will not include adapter plugin macros unless they are from the currently-in-use adapter or one of its dependencies [#2590](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2590)
- `adapter_macro` is no longer a macro, instead it is a builtin context method. Any custom macros that intercepted it by going through `context['dbt']` will need to instead access it via `context['builtins']` ([#2302](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2302), [#2673](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2673))
- `adapter_macro` is now deprecated. Use `adapter.dispatch` instead.
- Data tests are now written as CTEs instead of subqueries. Adapter plugins for adapters that don't support CTEs may require modification. ([#2712](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2712))

### Features

- The built-in schema tests now use `adapter.dispatch`, so they can be overridden for adapter plugins ([#2415](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2415), [#2684](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2684))

## Marian Anderson

Marian Anderson had “a voice heard once in a hundred years.” So said the Italian conductor Toscanini. Anderson was beloved in Europe, touring there through the 1930s after racism kept from preeminence in her native country. (The Philadelphia Music Academy, now University of the Arts, denied her entry on the basis that it was all-white.) As the Philadelphia Inquirer noted, Anderson “had a much finer reputation in Russia, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, England and other cities on the continent than here in her own country.”

If the Daughters of the American Revolution had their way, Anderson wouldn't have had the homecoming she deserved in 1939; they refused her use of Constitution Hall in Washington, DC. (After coordinated protest by racial-justice and labor organizations, many DAR members resigned, including First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.) Instead, on April 9, 75,000 Americans watched Anderson sing live, in open-air concert, before the Lincoln Memorial. Hundreds of thousands would watch her perform in the same spot again, 24 years later, in a [March on Washington she helped inspire](https://themarch.uoregon.edu/making-the-march-on-washington).

Though Anderson's wider fame receded in the decades after her retirement, she long remained an integral fixture of Black arts and music in Philadelphia. Blanche Burton-Lyles, a former protégé of Anderson's, and the first Black woman pianist to graduate from Philadelphia's Curtis Institute of Music, has dedicated the years since Anderson's death in 1993 (and much of her own money) to rescuing her Martin Street rowhouse.

Today, the [Marian Anderson Historical Society & Museum](http://marianandersonhistoricalsociety.weebly.com/) sits between 19th & 20th Streets, Fitzwater & Catharine: squarely in the middle of Graduate Hospital, the most gentrified neighborhood in Philadelphia. Disinvestment in the 60s and 70s followed ill-conceived plans to run an interstate highway down South Street, giving way to rapid redevelopment in the last few decades. Since 1990, the proportion of Black residents has decreased from 90 to 35 percent, while the median income doubled. Some newer residents hope to [rename the neighborhood in her honor](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/columnists/inga_saffron/philadelphia-neighborhood-names-graduate-hospital-marian-anderson-20180719.html); what would it mean to honor and remember the community as it was before?

At a time when so many are rediscovering their neighborhoods out of necessity, many others are at risk of losing their homes and historical ties to community. The voices of history call on us to take a longer view, [and what a voice it was](https://youtu.be/XF9Quk0QhSE?t=60).
