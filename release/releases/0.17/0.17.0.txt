version: 0.17.0

## dbt 0.17.0 - Octavius Catto (June 8th, 2020)

### Breaking changes
- Added a new dbt_project.yml version format. This emits a deprecation warning currently, but support for the existing version will be removed in a future dbt version ([#2300](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2300), [#2312](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2312))
- The `graph` object available in some dbt contexts now has an additional member `sources` (along side the existing `nodes`). Sources have been removed from `nodes` and added to `sources` instead ([#2312](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2312))
- The 'location' field has been removed from bigquery catalogs ([#2382](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2382))
- The `list_relations_without_caching`, `drop_schema`, and `create_schema` macros and methods now accept a single argument of a Relation object with no identifier field. ([#2411](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2411))

### Features

#### Core
- Add `--fail-fast` argument for dbt run and dbt test to fail on first test failure or runtime error. ([#1649](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/1649), [#2224](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2224))
- Support for appending query comments to SQL queries. ([#2138](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2138), [#2199](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2199))
- Add a `get-manifest` API call. ([#2168](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2168), [#2232](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2232))
- Support adapter-specific aliases (like `project` and `dataset` on BigQuery) in source definitions. ([#2133](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2133), [#2244](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2244))
- Users can now use jinja as arguments to tests. Test arguments are rendered in the native context and injected into the test execution context directly. ([#2149](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2149), [#2220](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2220))
- Users can supply paths as arguments to `--models` and `--select`, either explicitily by prefixing with `path:` or implicitly with no prefix. ([#454](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/454), [#2258](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2258))
- dbt now builds the relation cache for "dbt compile" and "dbt ls" as well as "dbt run" ([#1705](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/1705), [#2319](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2319))
- Add a 'depends_on' attribute to the log record extra field ([#2316](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2316), [#2341](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2341))
- Add a '--no-browser' argument to "dbt docs serve" so you can serve docs in an environment that only has a CLI browser which would otherwise deadlock dbt ([#2004](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2004), [#2364](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2364))
- Sources (and therefore freshness tests) can be enabled and disabled via dbt_project.yml ([#2283](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2283), [#2312](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2312), [#2357](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2357))
- schema.yml files are now fully rendered in a context that is aware of vars declared in from dbt_project.yml files ([#2269](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2269), [#2357](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2357))

#### Snowflake
- Snowflake now uses "show terse objects" to build the relations cache instead of selecting from the information schema ([#2174](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2174), [#2322](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2322))
- Snowflake now uses "describe table" to get the columns in a relation ([#2260](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2260), [#2324](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2324))
- Snowflake now uses "describe table" to get the columns in a relation ([#2260](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2260), [#2324](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2324))
