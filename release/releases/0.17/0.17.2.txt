## dbt 0.17.2 (July 29, 2020)

This is a bugfix release with one breaking change, which may be relevant to users of community-supported plugins.

### Breaking changes (for plugins)
- The `release` argument to `adapter.execute_macro` no longer has any effect. It will be removed in a future release of dbt, likely v0.18.0. ([#2650](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2650))

### Features
- Added environment variables for debug-level logging ([#2633](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2633), [#2635](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2635))

### Fixes
- When using the `--fast-fail` option with adapters that don't support cancelling queries (e.g. BigQuery), dbt will include the original database error in its log messages ([#2644](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2644), [#2646](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2646))
- `dbt clean` does not require a profile ([#2620](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2620), [#2649](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2649))
- On Redshift, the catalog contains information for all schemas in a project, rather than just the default ([#2653](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2653), [#2654](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2654))
- On Snowflake, close all connections so keepalive thread will exit ([#2645](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2645), [#2650](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2650))

### Docs
- Fix background appearance of markdown ` ``` ` code blocks ([docs#114](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-docs/pull/114), [docs#115](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-docs/pull/115))
