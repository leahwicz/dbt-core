## dbt 0.17.1 (July 20, 2020)

This is a bugfix release with one breaking change and one enhancement of an existing feature.

### Breaking changes
- dbt native rendering is no longer enabled by default, as it was in v0.17.0. It requires the use of opt-in filters: `as_native`, `as_bool`, and `as_number`. ([#2612](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2612), [#2618](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2618))

### Features
- On BigQuery, `persist_docs` persists descriptions for nested columns ([#2549](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2549), [#2550](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2550))

### Fixes
- Hash names of local packages ([#2600](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2600))
- Handle too-long file paths on Windows ([#2591](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2591), [#2558](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2558), [#2566](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2566), [#2603](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2603))
- Fix a bug where `persist_docs` ignored seeds on BigQuery ([#2598](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2598), [#2601](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2601))
- Fix a bug where dbt `config-version: 2` rendered `+pre-hook` and `+post-hook` fields too eagerly ([#2583](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2583), [#2854](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2854))
- Fix a bug where `dbt compile` and `dbt ls` would create schemas if they didn't already exist ([#2525](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2525), [#2528](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2528))
- Fix a bug where `dbt deps` ignored the `--project-dir` flag ([#2519](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2519), [#2534](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2534))
- Fix a bug where parallel RPC requests confounded each others' arguments ([[#2484](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2484), [#2554](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2554)])
- Fix a bug where dbt ignored config aliases in config() calls and dbt_project.yml ([#2557](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/issues/2557), [#2559](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2559), [#2575](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt/pull/2575))
- Fix unclickable nodes in the dbt Docs DAG viz ([#101](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-docs/pull/101))
- Fix relation names with null databases (i.e. Spark) in dbt Docs site ([#96](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-docs/pull/96))
