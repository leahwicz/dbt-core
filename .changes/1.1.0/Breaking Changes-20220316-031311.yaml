  **Relevant to maintainers of adapter plugins _only_:**
  The abstractmethods `get_response` and `execute` now only return a `connection.AdapterReponse` in type hints.
  (Previously, they could return a string.) We encourage you to update your methods to return an object of
  class `AdapterResponse`, or implement a subclass specific to your adapter
